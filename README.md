Project Title

Improving Employee Retension by Logistic Regression

Project Overview

Salifort Motors seeks to improve employee retention. Since the variable we are seeking to predict is categorical, the team could build either a logistic regression model

Business Understanding 

The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. If we can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company. 

Data Understanding 

The HR Department of Salifort Motors collected data from employees. There are 14,999 rows and 10 columns. Most employees stayed around 3 to 4 years. However, there are a few outliers Employees who left fall into two general categories: dissatisfied employees with shorter tenures and very satisfied employees with medium-length tenures.

Modeling and Evaluation 

A logistic regression model was used to predict whether an employee will leave the company. 

Conclusion

The model confirmed that employees are overworked.
- Cap the # of projects that employees can work on
- Consider promoting employees who have been with the company for over 4 years
- Reward employees for working long hours
- Make the overtime pay policy expectations about workload and time off clear
- Hold workshops to adress the company culture to the employees
- 
Next step: We could use K-means model on the data.
